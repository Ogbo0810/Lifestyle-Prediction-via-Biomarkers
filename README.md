# Lifestyle-Prediction-via-Biomarkers
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict lifestyle based on biological measurements and results

The specific aims for our lifestyle prediction project are as follows:
1. Benchmarking of different machine learning algorithms for lifestyle prediction.
  For measuring the performance of the algorithms, we will use the following metrics:
  	Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall
    F1-score
    ROC Curve and AUC
    Mean Squared Error
    Confusion Matrix
2. Based on the best-performing individual classifiers, develop and evaluate ensemble classifiers.
3. Employing feature engineering techniques to create efficient classifiers.
